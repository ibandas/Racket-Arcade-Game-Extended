The goal of this assignment is to extend your falling
game.

In addition to the extensions listed below, find all
opportunities to abstract the functions that you have
already written using map, filter, and other such
higher-order functions.

1) make objects that would be touching the paddle, if
   they were at the bottom of the screen, look different.
   That is, help the player to understand the extent of the
   paddle with a subtly different faller image. (This
   applies to the new types of fallers you add for the
   second part of the homework too.)

2) make a new type of faller, such that, when it touches
   the paddle, the paddle gets wider and another such that,
   when it touches the paddle, the paddle gets narrower.
   These fallers should appear at regular intervals (not
   randomly) in your game. For example, every 10th faller
   could be a shrinking faller, say.

In order to avoid being overwhelmed by the changes to
the game, first be sure you have a good test suite for
your existing game. Second, pick only one small aspect
of the above bullets to work on first. Break the changes
up into two phases: a refactoring phase and then a
semantics-breaking change. That is, first change the
program in such a way that the game plays the same as it
played before but that prepares you for the new game's
behavior. Once that change is implemented and tested,
then change the behavior in a second (usually much
easier) step. At each stage, make sure you have a
complete set of passing tests and, even better, check
each change in to git so you can exploit the 'git diff'
command.

Note that changing the data definition of Fw-World is a
good idea. Think carefully about the changes, though,
and don't be afraid to change your mind about what the
best changes are.

Note that your final submission should be consistent,
(i.e., make sure your signatures, templates, tests,
bodies, etc etc are all matched up as if they had been
written from scratch with the final data definitions you
end up using).
